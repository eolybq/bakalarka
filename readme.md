## Abstract
This project aims to examine how unconventional monetary policy has influenced inflation expectations of selected economic agents in the Czech Republic, the euro area and Sweden. To achieve this goal, the vector autoregression method is used, potentially extended with exogenous variables. The results show that quantitative easing has no statistically significant impact the inflation expectations of individual agents. In contrast, forward guidance aimed at loosening policy shows a predominantly significant effect, both positive and negative. Forward guidance signalling tightening of monetary policy shows a significant negative effect.
